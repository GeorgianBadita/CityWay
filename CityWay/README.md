<h3> Innovation Labs Hackathon 2019 </h3>

- Built an Android application for electric scooter sharing.
   My team was among the best ones which granted us a
  mentorship program to further develop our product.
- Used Google Firebase for cloud storage and Android Studio for
  the application.
- Worked in a team of 4 on development of a real product.
